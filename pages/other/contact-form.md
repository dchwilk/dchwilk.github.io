subtitle: |
  A simple form to send requests via email.
permalink: /contact-form/
contact: true
hero_tags: subpage

## Should look like this:

<figure class="image">
  <img src="{{baseurl}}/assets/templates/contact.png">
</figure>

## How it works

Currently is the contact form hardcoded an can be added to a page with the meta-tag:

```html
contact: true
```
